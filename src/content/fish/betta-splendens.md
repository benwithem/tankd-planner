# Betta Fish (Siamese Fighting Fish)

Bettas are known for their vibrant colors and flowing fins. They're a popular choice for beginners due to their hardiness and striking appearance.

## Care Notes

Male bettas cannot be kept together as they will fight aggressively. Females can be kept in groups (called sororities) with caution in tanks 40L or larger with plenty of hiding places.

## Feeding

Feed high-quality betta pellets as a staple diet, supplemented with frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, or daphnia 2-3 times weekly.
