Aponogeton ulvaceus is a submerged aquatic plant native to Madagascar, known for its wavy, translucent leaves. It thrives in slightly alkaline water conditions and benefits from additional COâ‚‚ supplementation for more luxuriant growth. This plant prefers bright lighting but can also grow in partial shade. Regular pruning is recommended to manage its rapid growth and prevent it from overtaking the aquarium.
