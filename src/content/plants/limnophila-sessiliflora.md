Limnophila sessiliflora, commonly known as Dwarf Ambulia, is a fast-growing aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, bright green leaves arranged in whorls, resembling Cabomba species. Under strong lighting, the leaves may exhibit a reddish hue. This plant thrives in high lighting conditions and benefits from nutrient-rich substrates. While COâ‚‚ supplementation is optional, it can enhance growth. Regular pruning is recommended to maintain its shape and prevent it from overshadowing other plants. Dwarf Ambulia is suitable for beginners due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate.
