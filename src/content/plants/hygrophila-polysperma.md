Hygrophila polysperma, or Dwarf Hygrophila, is a fast-growing stem plant with light green leaves. It adapts well to a wide range of water conditions and thrives under moderate lighting. Regular pruning is recommended to maintain its shape and prevent it from overshadowing other plants. COâ‚‚ supplementation is optional but can enhance growth.
