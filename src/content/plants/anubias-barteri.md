Anubias barteri is a hardy, slow-growing plant ideal for beginners. It features broad, dark green leaves and thrives in low lighting conditions. Instead of planting it directly into the substrate, it's best attached to rocks or driftwood, ensuring the rhizome remains exposed to prevent rot. This plant is well-suited for aquariums with herbivorous fish, as it is rarely eaten.
